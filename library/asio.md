# ASIO integration
The asy::op project provide a reference implementation of integration with ASIO in a form of separete `asyop::asio` library. As it was stated in Getting started section, it is conditionally available when `add_subdirectory()` and always avaliable using `find_package()`.

The `asyop::asio` library is not intrusive and designed to provide quick start helpers for asy::op users.
